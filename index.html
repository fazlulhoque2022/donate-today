            <h1>Let’s Help Those Who Are Flood Affected</h1>
            <p>Incessant rain and onrush of water from upstream have been ravaging the whole Sylhet region. Thousands of
                people
                are stranded in flood water. While the whole Sylhet region is affected by the deadly floods, the
                situation
                in
                Sunamganj is especially devastating. Thousands of people have become marooned and they do not have any
                dry
                place
                to take shelter. Many people are starving. Lightning strikes have exacerbated the situation. Sunamganj’s
                communication with other parts of the country has become cut off as the Sylhet-Sunamganj highway had
                gone
                under
                water.
